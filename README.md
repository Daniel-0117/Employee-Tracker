## Description
This command line project was created so that employers will have an easy to understand database. That will perform functions such as viewing, adding, or updating all employees, departments, and roles. This way someone who is unfamilair with MySQL can query a database without the frustration one unversed with MySQL might rightfully have. 

## Usage
To begin the application the user must clone this repo. Then once properly cloned the user has to perform npm install into the integrated terminal. Once all modules are properly installed the application is truelly ready. Putting npm start to start the application there they will be presented with the all the options needed to run a database.
